<p>Actress and singer Grace Jones is best known for her roles in the feature films 'Conan the Destroyer' and 'A View to a Kill' as well as the '80s albums 'Warm Leatherette,' 'Nightclubbing' and 'Slave to the Rhythm.'</p>

<p>Singer and actress Grace Jones was born in Jamaica in 1948 and was raised there and in Syracuse, New York. At age 17, she left college to pursue a career in modeling and eventually moved to Paris, France, where her striking appearance made her a success. In 1977 Jones transitioned into the music world when she was signed to Island Records. She released several albums over the next few years, including 1981's Nightclubbing, before reinventing herself yet again, appearing in several feature films during the 1980s and '90s, including the James Bond picture A View to a Kill and the comedy Boomerang. Since then, Jones has continued to act, record and perform. </p>

<p>As a model, actress and singer, Grace Jones has consistently been an extreme and challenging presence in the world of entertainment since her emergenace as a model in the mid seventies. Through her early albums, she developed herself as a gay icon and disco queen. In the eightees Grace explored the boundaries of reggae music with the likes of Sly & Robbie, which led to hits such as ‘Pull up to the Bumper’ and ‘I’ve Seen that Face Before’. Between music and fashion, Grace also played major parts in blockbuster movies like ‘Conan the Destroyer’ and the James Bond flick ‘A View to a Kill’.</p>

<p>As a musician, her work spans 10 studio albums, beginning in disco and transitioning to 1980s New Wave. Her film career has included acting in 21 films and one video game — Hell: A Cyberpunk Thriller. Over the past five decades, Jones’s bold, androgynous, angular aesthetic has penetrated the depths of pop culture and fine art.</p>

<p>At the Museum of the African Diaspora (MoAD), The Grace Jones Project chronicles her legacy through a collection of more than 20 contemporary artworks interspersed with vintage album covers, videos of her performances, and wall text detailing Jones’s global influence. Some of the works in the show pay tribute to Jones and some were chosen because they address relevant subjects, like the black body or queer identity. </p>

<p>The exhibition includes still art as well as several video installations and a floor-to-ceiling projection that cycles through short films. It features work from artists including Jacolby Satterwhite, Simone Leigh, and Wangechi Mutu. Satterwhite’s video installation juxtaposes footage of a solo dance piece with a futuristic digital animation that excavates gender expression and queer identity. </p>

<p>Jones' work is often discussed for its visual aspect, which was largely the work of French illustrator, photographer, and graphic designer Jean-Paul Goude. According to Jake Hall of i-D, "their collaborative work [went on] to define the visual landscape of the 70s and 80s," and "the artist helped create one of the most intriguing legends in musical history." </p>

<p>Goude saw Jones as his muse, declaring she was "beautiful and grotesque at the same time," and dated her from 1977 to 1984. He "[designed her] album covers, [...] directed her music videos, choreographed live performances, and helped develop her image." </p>

<p>It has been noted that Jones' ties with high art are important in understanding her visual identity during this period - "her links with pop art were well-documented", and "she was famously close with Andy Warhol, Richard Bernstein and renowned within the art world. Jones' "appearance was equally divisive" as the sonic fluidity of her music - with her "striking visuals [leading] to her becoming a muse for the likes of Issey Miyake and Thierry Mugler. Her image has been described as "neo-cubist".</p>

<p>The Grace Jones Project explores the influence of model, actress, and singer Grace Jones. The exhibition brings together more than twenty works by an intergenerational group of artists working primarily in photography, video, and performance. Some artists pay direct tribute to Jones while others demonstrate a Jones-like sensibility in their engagement with the black body and queer identity. </p>

<p>Central to the exhibition are vintage album covers and performance videos that highlight the music and stage personae that made Jones a cultural icon, and one of the most important performers to emerge in the late twentieth century.</p>
