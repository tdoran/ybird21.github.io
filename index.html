<h1>Actress and singer Grace Jones is best known for her roles in the feature films 'Conan the Destroyer' and 'A View to a Kill' as well as the '80s albums 'Warm Leatherette,' 'Nightclubbing' and 'Slave to the Rhythm.'

Singer and actress Grace Jones was born in Jamaica in 1948 and was raised there and in Syracuse, New York. At age 17, she left college to pursue a career in modeling and eventually moved to Paris, France, where her striking appearance made her a success. In 1977 Jones transitioned into the music world when she was signed to Island Records. She released several albums over the next few years, including 1981's Nightclubbing, before reinventing herself yet again, appearing in several feature films during the 1980s and '90s, including the James Bond picture A View to a Kill and the comedy Boomerang. Since then, Jones has continued to act, record and perform.</h1>
